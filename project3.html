  <p style = "font-size:15px"> Electrophysiological recordings are highly non - stationary signals and therefore, difficult to model. We present a generative model that captures 
   the dynamics of these recordings with high â€“ time resolution. Our representation allows for inferences beyond the scope of standard time-frequency based models.</p>

   <p  style = "font-size:15px"> Working memory (WM) is a cognitive process by which salient sensory information is held temporarily during task execution.  
    We were insterested in studying the role of neuromodulations as encoders of cognitive content. We present our results on field potentials recorded from the prelimbic and secondary
motor cortices of 3 rats while performing a WM task.

<img src="Picture4.jpg" alt="Sleep Analysis">
<p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 15px"> Sleep spindles result from interactions between the thalamic and cortical 
 neurons during the NREM2 stage. Studies show that these waxing and waning episodes of field potentials may have an implied role in memory consolidation,
cellular plasticity and neuronal development besides serving as important markers in several neuronal pathologies. For these reasons, 
 accurate spindle scoring of polysomnographic signals is important and has garnered interest in automating the tedious
process of scoring via visual inspection. In this project, we employ the transient model for neuromodulatory events 
  as a generalized automatic sleep spindle detector. </p>
