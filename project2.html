<p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 15px"> Working memory is a complex cognitive process involved in encoding, storing and retrieving 
 sensory information. The process can be divided into 3 sub-phases: memory creation, maintenance and retrieval. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been shown to maintain transiently elevated activity during delay period
in cued choice memory guided tasks. However, another school of thought supports, additionally, the involvement of population activity that
are exemplified in the complex dynamics underlying the field potentials. These dynamics correspond to oscillatory bursts (i.e., neuromodulations) 
in the gamma and beta frequency bands. </p>
 
 <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 15px">  Through this study, we aim to summarize the involvement of oscillatory dynamics
as the brain transitions between the different WM states during task execution. We sought to validate our hypothesis that neuromodulatory events
 indicate the emergence of task variables, are representative of the stimulus, as well as encode correlates of executive control; 
and therefore, they may be predictive of behavior. Simultaneously, we asked two critical questions: 1) what is the nature of encoding of neuromodulations?
and 2) how important is time - resolution for abstracting relevant information from field potentials? </p>
