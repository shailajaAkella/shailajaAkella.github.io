<p> <em>  I am a fourth year PhD candidate pursuing Neuroengineering under the supervision of Dr. Jose C. Principe. 
 My doctoral research involves: 
 (a) designing generative models that capture transient phasic events observed in electrophysiological recordings from the brain (EEG, MEG, ECoG, etc.) 
 (b) developing a robust feature space from the properties of the identified transient events for effective prediction of subject intent and 
 (c) studying the adaptive local communications between neural populations to construct functional connectivity maps in behaving animals.
<p> My work heavily derives from the fields of machine learning, statisical signal processing and information theoretic learning. 
Besides my interest in neuroscience related questions, I also proactively research other areas of machine learning through coursework and academic projects.
