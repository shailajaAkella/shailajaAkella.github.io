  <p style = "font-size:15px"> Electrophysiological recordings are highly non - stationary signals and therefore, difficult to model. We present a generative model that captures 
   the dynamics of these recordings with high – time resolution. Our representation allows for inferences beyond the scope of standard time-frequency based models.</p>

   <p  style = "font-size:15px"> Working memory (WM) is a cognitive process by which salient sensory information is held temporarily during task execution.  
    We were insterested in studying the role of neuromodulations as encoders of cognitive content. We present our results on field potentials recorded from the prelimbic and secondary
motor cortices of 3 rats while performing a WM task.

    <p style = "font-size:15px"> Stage II of Non - Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep is marked by stereotypical high frequency spike clusters known as sleep spindles, observable in the cortical electroencephalograms. 
     The identification of sleep spindles is usually carried out by visual inspection of signals obtained from polysomnography studies which both tedious and prone to errors. 
     In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of our model as a generalized sleep spindle detector. </p>
