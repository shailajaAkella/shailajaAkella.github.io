<img src="Picture1.jpg" alt="neuromodulations">
<p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 15px"> Field potentials recorded from the brain (invasive or non - invasively) are non - stationary signals that represent the dynamic interactions between local neural populations. 
Synchronized interactions between populations then manifest as oscillatory bursts in the field potentials. These bursts are called neuromodulations and have been recognized 
 by clinicians as bursts of rhythmic activity that wax and wane when eyeballing the signal. Further, they are temporally sparse and transient. On the other hand,  
 unsynchronized interactions contribute to background activity that is featureless and unstructured. </p>
 <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 15px"> Neuromodulatory patterns command much interest because of their role as potential biological markers in the early detection of neurological diseases and as pneural 
  patterns carrying cognitive content. While classical signal processing techniques attempt to identify these oscillatory bursts using spectral representations of the signal, such analyses demand more specialized methods that 
  incorporate the neurophysiology of signal generation and high-time resolution. In this project, we aim to adress these issues to classify and characterize neuromodulations 
  from field potentials. We do so in an unsupervised manner using information theoretic measures, sparse-coding techniques and point process modeling. </p>

<img src="Picture3.jpg" alt="WM">
<p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 15px"> Working memory is a complex cognitive process involved in encoding, storing and retrieving 
 sensory information. The process can be divided into 3 sub-phases: memory creation, maintenance and retrieval. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been shown to maintain transiently elevated activity during delay period
in cued choice memory guided tasks. However, another school of thought supports, additionally, the involvement of population activity that
are exemplified in the complex dynamics underlying the field potentials. These dynamics correspond to oscillatory bursts (i.e., neuromodulations) 
in the gamma and beta frequency bands. </p>
 
 <p style = "text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word; font-size: 15px">  Through this study, we aim to summarize the involvement of oscillatory dynamics
as the brain transitions between the different WM states during task execution. We sought to validate our hypothesis that neuromodulatory events
 indicate the emergence of task variables, are representative of the stimulus, as well as encode correlates of executive control; 
and therefore, they may be predictive of behavior. Simultaneously, we asked two critical questions: 1) what is the nature of encoding of neuromodulations?
and 2) how important is time - resolution for abstracting relevant information from field potentials? </p>
