<img src="Picture1.jpg" alt="neuromodulations">
Field potentials recorded from the brain (invasive or non - invasively) are non - stationary signals that represent the dynamic interactions between local neural populations. 
Synchronized interactions between populations then manifest as oscillatory bursts in the field potentials. These bursts are called neuromodulations and have been recognized 
 by clinicians as bursts of rhythmic activity that wax and wane when eyeballing the signal. Further, they are temporally sparse and transient. On the other hand,  
 unsynchronized interactions contribute to background activity that is featureless and unstructured. 
 <p> Neuromodulatory patterns command much interest because of their role as potential biological markers in the early detection of neurological diseases and as pneural 
  patterns carrying cognitive content. In this project, we aim to classify and characterize neuromodulations from field potentials in an unsupervised manner 
  using sparse coding techniques and point process modeling. </p>
