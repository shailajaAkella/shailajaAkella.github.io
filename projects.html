<img src="Picture1.jpg" alt="neuromodulations">
Field potentials recorded from the brain (invasive or non - invasively) are non - stationary signals that represent the dynamic interactions between local neural populations. 
Synchronized interactions between populations then manifest as oscillatory bursts in the field potentials. These bursts are called neuromodulations, and have been recognized by 
clinicians as bursts of rhythmic activity that wax and wane when eyeballing the signal. Further, they are temporally sparse and transient in nature. On the other hand, 
unsynchronized interactions contribute to background activity that are featureless and unstructured. 
<p>Neuromodulatory patterns command much clinical interest because of their role as potential biological markers in early detection of neurological diseases and 
as potential patterns carrying cognitive content. In this project, we aim to classify and characterize neuromodulations from field potentials in an unsupervised manner for 
improved application in clinical and research settings.  </p>
